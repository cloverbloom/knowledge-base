### [Building Companies]
*****
* In building a company the idea of "company culture" is predatory

	* People detest the idea of committing their lives towards companies
	  
	* If your product is worth employing so many people, take time to develop them into educated and useful entities

* **What I would do:**

	* Either require or reward employees who completed various assigned works:
	
		* *Atomic Habits
		
		* *The 12-Week Year*
	  
	* Ultimately you will lose individuals. Some will be inspired to act and some will leave to pursue their own ambitions
	  
	* Inevitably you would be left with individuals who respect the authority and mission of the company for helping them
	  
		* Commitment would rise along with knowledge across the company on how to actually get things done
		  
		* Individual metrics would be far higher than average
		  
		* You could also explain and structure the company under a quarter schedule far better
	
	* Assign team leaders to manage and discuss the ideas with employees and how to apply this in their daily lives

* To build effective teams have monthly 1-on-1 sessions with employees to force them to reflect on their own ambitions and if the company truly fits with their aspirations
