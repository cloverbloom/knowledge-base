## **Building**
* In building a company the idea of "company culture" is predatory.
	* People detest the idea of committing their lives towards companies.
* `Would it really be so impactful if companies actually helped people?`
	* If your product is worth employing so many people, take time to develop them into educated and useful entities.
	* How else are you really supposed to grow?
* **What I would do:**
	* Either require or reward employees who completed various assigned works:
		* *Atomic Habits*
		* *The 12-Week Year*
	* Ultimately you will lose individuals. Some will be inspired to act and some will leave to pursue their own ambitions.
	* Inevitably you would be left with individuals who respect the authority and mission of the company for helping them.
		* Commitment would rise along with knowledge across the company on how to actually get things done.
		* Individual metrics would be far higher than average.
		* You could also explain and structure the company under a quarter schedule far better.
