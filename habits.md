# **Atomic Habits - Organized Notes**

## **The Science of Habit Formation**

### **Habit Fundamentals**
- Habits develop and atrophy like muscles.
	- Parts of the brain associated with Habit forming and Addiction grow and die with the individual's habits.
- **Repetition is the most important thing**
	- Add reps to habits you want to keep.
	- Stop practicing habits you want to lose.
- **All Habits have stages**
	1. Cue
	2. Craving
	3. Response
	4. Reward

### **The Psychology Behind Habits**
* `Emotions are a signal to change your current state. The problem is that they don't tell you what to do, so we seek the option of least resistance.`
	* The path of least resistance in all aspects of life is never the best solution.
	* `The shortcut is always the longest path.`
	* Need to identify when the response was incorrect and analyze what the better response should have been.
* The "path of least resistance" (or "law of least resistance") `refers to the tendency of systems, objects, or individuals to take the easiest or most straightforward path, often avoiding effort or resistance.`
* `What is immediately rewarded is repeated what is immediately punished is avoided.`

### **Human Psychology and Evolution**
- **We have out evolved our brains.**
- Our ability to create desire for food, sex, calm anxiety, socialize, etc. easily and in mass excess have caused us to far out evolve our evolutionary instincts and triggers.
- We want to reproduce at all times.
- Being proactive to eat an abundance of food would increase survival rates - now we must limit our intake every day.
- We can socialize now without leaving our house.
- All of our habits latch onto deeper motivations.
- Our brains have minimally changed in the last 200,000 years.

## **Building Better Habits**

### **Creating Good Habits**
* Reward Good Habits immediately.
* Constantly revise your current habits to eliminate any friction.
* For habits you struggle in creating:
	* ex. no positive rewards to attach, dislike learning the habit, etc.
	* `Start small - ex. only do 2 minutes of meditation per day and increase each week or month.`

### **Habit Stacks**
* In order to have my daily 8 oz. Coffee I must first do 10 minutes of meditation.
	* *Use something you like to reward something you dislike.*
* My Morning Habit Stack is:
	1. Wakeup
	2. Use Bathroom
	3. Wash Face
	4. Hair Care
	5. Review Previous Day
* My Night Habit Stack is:
	1. Charge Phone from Desk
	2. Prepare Water & Electrolytes
	3. Brush Teeth

### **Eliminating Bad Habits**
* Make Bad Habits as difficult as possible.
* `To truly work you must completely eliminate all cues and cravings for said bad habit:`
	* Removed and blocked all forms of social media and adult content from iPhone.
* Limit bad habits to as small of an environment as possible.
	* Want to reduce Cues.
* Add as much friction as possible.

### **Defining Self Control**
* This bad habit is ingrained in my psychology as a human being.
	* Is there truly a way to avoid these desires in the short term?
* We need to make this invisible, undesirable, difficult, and unrewarding.
* Book for quitting smoking could be useful to identifying all aspects of a negative habit and how to rationalize it is bad for you.
	* I accept that this habit is very bad for me.

#### **Consistent Sleep**
- “Insomniacs were instructed to only get into bed when tired. If unable to sleep, stay in a different room until you feel tired.”
	- Drives the habit of only associating the bedroom with sleeping and with getting into bed with being tired.

#### **Developing my Community**
- **Moving right away is the right idea.**
- I need to reinforce the herd habits I want to see in myself. 
- Our habits mimic three groups:
	- The Close
	- The Many
	- The Powerful
- Women associate power with connections, money, and status.
	- These convey power and stability to survive.
- All of our habits latch onto deeper motivations.
	- We cannot eliminate the desire to reproduce, eat, socialize, etc.
	- We instead must produce an environment and herd that is conductive to how we want to satisfy these needs.

#### **Human Psychology**
- **We have out evolved our brains.**
- Our ability to create desire for food, sex, calm anxiety, socialize, etc. easily and in mass excess have caused us to far out evolve our evolutionary instincts and triggers.
- We want to reproduce at all times.
- Being proactive to eat an abundance of food would increase survival rates - now we must limit our intake every day.
- We can socialize now without leaving our house.
- All of our habits latch onto deeper motivations.
- Our brains have minimally changed in the last 200,000 years.

#### **Automation**
- Automation for small parts of habits are super effective but you need to be careful because it causes actions to take zero effort.
	- Essentially make sure it is the right thing to do.

#### **Acknowledging my Mistakes**
- I have been in “motion” for years. Actual “action” hasn’t been tracked or prioritized.
- `“Motion spares us the pain that action brings, but only action brings true pleasure in results.”`
#### **Habit Science**
- Habits develop and atrophy like muscles.
	- Parts of the brain associated with Habit forming and Addiction grow and die with the individual’s habits.
- **Repetition is the most important thing**
	- Add reps to habits you want to keep.
	- Stop practicing habits you want to lose.

* The "path of least resistance" (or "law of least resistance") `refers to the tendency of systems, objects, or individuals to take the easiest or most straightforward path, often avoiding effort or resistance.`
* Break larger habits down into phases:
	* Works well with the **12-W Year** and 3 month sections to ex. add one habit phase each month.
* When you have motivation you need to act on it.
	- `“Inspiration is temporary. Act on it.`
	- ex. Ulysses from the Odyssey - use your motivation in the moment to help yourself in the future.
	- Lock in your current decision before you get a chance to regret it.
- Sensory benefits like smells or sensations are very effective in engaging cues.
- `What is immediately rewarded is repeated what is immediately punished is avoided.`
#### **The Law of Relativity**
* **Special Relativity**
	- **Postulates:**
    - The laws of physics are the same for all observers in uniform motion (inertial frames of reference). 
    - The speed of light in a vacuum is the same for all observers, regardless of the motion of the light source.     
	- **Consequences:**
    - Time dilation: Time passes slower for a moving observer relative to a stationary observer. 
    - Length contraction: Objects appear shorter in the direction of motion. 
    - Mass-energy equivalence (E=mc²): Mass and energy are interchangeable. 
    - Relativity of simultaneity: Events that are simultaneous for one observer may not be simultaneous for another in relative motion. 
	* General Relativity 
	- **Core Idea:**
	- Gravity is not a force, but rather a curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy. 
	- **Postulates:**
    - The principle of equivalence: The effects of gravity are indistinguishable from the effects of acceleration. 
    - Spacetime is a four-dimensional continuum (three spatial dimensions and one time dimension). 
	- **Consequences:**
    - Gravitational time dilation: Time passes slower in stronger gravitational fields. 
    - Bending of light: Light rays bend as they pass through a gravitational field. 
    - Gravitational waves: Distortions in spacetime that propagate as ripples, predicted by general relativity. 
    - Black holes: Regions of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape.

### **Practical Strategies**
- We respond well to visual progress.
	- `Reason for tracking everything.`
	- ex. Visual progress like moving paper clips for a certain number of tasks you need to do per day.
		- **Use this for Job applications.**
- **Using a Paper Planner**
	- This is my preferred method for time tracking, reviewing my day, and planning new strategies to improve my schedules.
	- Use this instead of an online calendar.
- **Make a daily habit to come up with one business idea per day.**
- **The Human brain is drawn to progress:**
	- Likely because in the wild it is hard to track.
	- This is why using a Habit Tracker or in general tracking anything that **needs** to be done is so impactful.
		- Running a company or group use measurement to define goals and people will meet them.
- **Finding what I am naturally good at and excites me is the easy way to develop good habits and see progress.**
	- We all naturally have habits that work best with our personalities.
	- We enjoy what comes naturally to us because it reduces friction.
		- Regardless anything can be done.
	- **Where do I get greater returns than the average person?**

#### **Quotes**
- `The first mistake isn’t what breaks you, it’s when you let yourself get into a downward spiral.`
- I would rather force myself to learn accountability (owning the situation regardless of the circumstances) than to sign contracts with others for my behavior.
