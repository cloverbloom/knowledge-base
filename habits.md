### [Habit Science]
*****
- Habits develop and atrophy like muscles.
    
    - Parts of the brain associated with Habit forming and Addiction grow and die with the individual’s habits.
    
- **Repetition is the most important thing**
    
    - Add reps to habits you want to keep.
        
    - Stop practicing habits you want to lose.
    
- **All Habits have stages**
    
    1. Cue
        
    2. Craving
        
    3. Response
        
    4. Reward
    
- `Emotions are a signal to change your current state. The problem is that they don’t tell you what to do, so we seek the option of least resistance.`
    
    - The path of least resistance in all aspects of life is never the best solution.
        
    - `The shortcut is always the longest path.`
        
    - Need to identify when the response was incorrect and analyze what the better response should have been.
    
- The "path of least resistance" (or "law of least resistance") `refers to the tendency of systems, objects, or individuals to take the easiest or most straightforward path, often avoiding effort or resistance.`
    
- `What is immediately rewarded is repeated what is immediately punished is avoided.`
    
- Flow state is an indication of enjoying the current task.
    
- Goldilocks law: motivation peaks when humans work on tasks that are right at the edge of their current ability.
    
- The maximization of dopamine reward is at a 50/50 split between success and failure.
    
    - This is the optimal range of difficulty for a task.
    
- To maintain motivation we need a variety of tasks and rewards upon completion.
    
    - Boredom is our biggest enemy and specifically when the mind starts to wander without a predefined plan.
        
    - Variable rewards help to add pleasure from repeating the same tasks.
    
- `"Successful people feel the same lack of motivation as everyone else. They can just handle the boredom from repeating the same tasks until the next round of motivation comes."`
    
- `"Professionals find ways to be endlessly fascinated by doing the same thing over and over."`
    
- **We have out evolved our brains.**
    
- Our brains have minimally changed in the last 200,000 years.
    
- Sensory benefits like smells or sensations are very effective in engaging cues.

### [Creating Good Habits]
*****
- Reward Good Habits immediately.
    
- Constantly revise your current habits to eliminate any friction.
    
- For habits you struggle in creating:
    
    - ex. no positive rewards to attach, dislike learning the habit, etc.
        
    - `Start small - ex. only do 2 minutes of meditation per day and increase each week or month.`
    
- The only downside to habits and especially with automation is you allow yourself to stop thinking.
    
    - Therefore you need to make sure that the habit you are trying to implement is something you want to maintain for a long time.
    
- You must set aside time periodically to review and revise your habits.
    
    - Additionally when trying to add another phase or round of habits.
    
- Ultimately you must cultivate your awareness of what you are doing at all times.
    
- Break larger habits down into phases:
    
    - Works well with the **12-W Year** and 3 month sections to ex. add one habit phase each month.
    
- When you have motivation you need to act on it.
    
    - `"Inspiration is temporary. Act on it.`
        
    - ex. Ulysses from the Odyssey - use your motivation in the moment to help yourself in the future.
        
    - Lock in your current decision before you get a chance to regret it.
    
- Automation for small parts of habits are super effective but you need to be careful because it causes actions to take zero effort.
    
    - Essentially make sure it is the right thing to do.
    
- Visual progress is effective.
    
    - `Reason for tracking everything.`
        
    - ex. Visual progress like moving paper clips for a certain number of tasks per day.
        
        - **Use this for Job applications.**
    
- **Finding what I am naturally good at and excites me is the easy way to develop good habits and see progress.**
    
    - We naturally have habits that fit our personalities.
        
    - Enjoy what comes naturally to reduce friction.
        
    - **Where do I get greater returns than the average person?**

### [Removing Bad Habits]
*****
- Make Bad Habits as difficult as possible.
    
- `To truly work you must completely eliminate all cues and cravings for said bad habit:`
    
- Limit bad habits to as small of an environment as possible.
    
    - Want to reduce Cues.
    
- Add as much friction as possible.
    
- This bad habit is ingrained in my psychology as a human being.
    
    - Is there truly a way to avoid these desires in the short term?
    
- We need to make this invisible, undesirable, difficult, and unrewarding.
    
- Book for quitting smoking could be useful to identifying all aspects of a negative habit and how to rationalize it is bad for you.
    
    - I accept that this habit is very bad for me.
    
- “Insomniacs were instructed to only get into bed when tired. If unable to sleep, stay in a different room until you feel tired.”
    
    - Drives the habit of only associating the bedroom with sleeping and being tired.
