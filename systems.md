# [The 12-W Year]

### [Core Concepts]

- Redefine a "year" as 12 weeks to create urgency and improve execution.
- Annualized thinking leads to procrastination; 12-week thinking creates focus and urgency.
- Define and track a **Weekly Score** to measure performance objectively.
- Shorter timeframes (12 weeks) increase predictability and clarity of goals.
- Be exceptional at 1-3 things rather than mediocre at many.
- Weaknesses rarely become strengths; consistently leveraging your strengths yields the greatest returns.
- Choose to spend time on activities that generate the highest payoffs.
- Everything requires sacrifice; comfort is often the first thing you must sacrifice.
- "Eventually everyone sits down at a banquet of consequences."
- `"To write a great book, you must first become the book." – Naval Ravikant`

### [The 3 Principles]
*****
* The 3 principles are:
  
	* (i) **accountability** (the willingness to take full ownership for your actions and results regardless of your circumstances), 
	  
	* (ii) **commitment** (doing whatever it takes to keep the promises you’ve made to yourself and to others)
	  
	* (iii) **greatness in the moment** (making the countless decisions to take critical action even if you don’t feel like it, and immersing yourself fully in the present)

### [The 5 Disciplines]
*****
* (iv) **vision** - Clearly define what you want to achieve

* (v) **planning** - Create specific, actionable 12-week plans

* (vi) **process Control** - Establish consistent routines and systems

* (vii) **measurement** - Track and score your execution

* (viii) **time Use** - Focus on high-value activities and block distractions

### [Vision & Planning]
*****
* Create a compelling vision that defines your long-term aspirations and desired future

* Develop 12-week plans with clear, specific goals that align with your vision

* `“You only have to doze a moment, and all is lost. For ruin and salvation both have their source inside you.”`

* `"You create things twice. First mentally, then physically."`

* You must be emotionally connected to the outcome

	* This will give you the necessary motivation to continue when it gets painful
  
* `"All my life I wanted to be somebody. Now I see I should have been more specific."`
  
* Review your vision daily to maintain emotional investment in your goals.
* Clearly define 1-3 core capabilities that align with your strengths and interests for sustained motivation and performance.
* Ultimately this book is not revolutionary -
  
	* **it is simply presenting things you already know in a way that you cannot ignore**

### [Planning Your Week]

- Weekly planning should take 15-30 minutes.
- Track habits daily (health-focused) and tasks weekly (goal-focused).
- Prioritize Health, Happiness, and Wealth—in that order.
- Schedule a consistent weekly planning session (e.g., Sunday morning).
- Use a physical planner to reinforce commitment and visibility.
- Clearly define measurable execution strategies and performance blocks:
  - Strategic, Buffer, and Breakout blocks.
- Include predictable events and commitments to realistically structure your week.
- Never start a week without a clear weekly plan.
- Weekly planning should include measurable execution strategies and clearly defined performance blocks.
- Understand you likely cannot finish everything planned; prioritize effectively.
- Use a physical planner to reinforce accountability and visibility of tasks.
- Keep your weekly plan visible and accessible throughout the week.

### [Execution System]
*****
* Focus on lead indicators (actions) rather than lag indicators (results)

* Implement weekly plans and daily actions to drive consistent progress

* Execution is a habit where direct measurement of performance is required
  
* You are always most effective when present (mediation is very important for this)
  
* Spend 8am-12pm daily on focused performance blocks.
* Initially schedule breakout blocks monthly, then transition to weekly once consistent.
* Strategic blocks are your most important activities; schedule them consistently each week.
* Avoid deferring today's tasks to tomorrow; this habit undermines execution.
* `"The whole is greater than the sum of the parts."` (must do all aspects)

### [Measurement & Accountability]
*****
* Accountability is ownership of the outcome regardless of the circumstances
  
	* Commitment is agreeing to future accountability
  
* Track execution consistently using a weekly scorecard (minimum 85% execution rate)

* Hold a weekly accountability meeting to review progress and adjust plans
  
* Action occurs when your stated intentions outweigh hidden intentions; evaluate the true cost of your actions.
* Trust is lost when commitments are not met; accountability starts with personal ownership.
* Never wait for external circumstances to change; proactively manage your accountability.
* `"Value the outcome over your comfort. Always take the leap of faith."`
  
* With a minimum 85% execution rate (on time) you are likely to meet your goals
  
* 60% of breakdowns occur in the execution phase (most likely to fail when actually working)

* **Leading** and **Lagging** indicators:
  
	* Leading indicators are measures of progress toward an end result
	  
	* Lagging indicators are the end results themselves, representing past performance
	  
		* You want to stack leading indicators to give yourself as much game time information as possible

* **Weekly Score**

	* Compiled from Sleep Score, Habit Score, and Task Score
	  
		* This is already automatically calculated in the 12-W Tracker
	  
	* Your Weekly Score does not care how you felt and only considers execution
	  
	* The 12-W Tracker considers your goals for Sleep, Habit, and Tasks and will provide you the **Minimum Good Week Score** indicating if your week was successful or not

* (viii) **time Use** - Focus on high-value activities and block distractions

### [Emotional Cycles]
*****
* Recognize the three emotional phases in each 12-week period: 
  
	* honeymoon, fight-through, and success

* Develop strategies to push through the "fight-through" phase when motivation wanes

* `"Don't be fair weather anything."`

* Recognize and manage emotional tension as deadlines approach; turning back is not an option.
* Maintain consistency, especially during the middle weeks when motivation wanes.
* `"Excellence is not an act. It is a way of being."`

### [Control Time Use]
*****
* Practice the following:
  
	* (i) how to get the highest return on your time
	  
	* (ii) pre-planning your week
	  
	* (iii) using strategic blocks to safeguard your time from being hijacked
	  
* All of your time must be intentional
  
* `“Take care of the minutes and the year will take care of themselves”`
  
* Organize your week with dedicated time blocks (must be put into physical planner)
  
	* Strategic Blocks - 3 hours each day for intense work to produce breakthroughs
	  
	* Buffer Blocks - max 30 minutes per day to deal with unplanned and unorganized tasks 
	  
		* ex. email, phone calls, updates, etc.
	  
	* Breakout Blocks - 3 hours per day for scheduled time away from work to maintain

* Interruptions cost significant productivity; it takes approximately 15 minutes to regain focus after each distraction.
* Follow the Model Work Week:
  1. Review previous week (15 min)
  2. Schedule one 3 hour strategic block per week
  3. Schedule 1-2 buffer blocks daily
  4. Schedule one 3 hour breakout block per week (one per month until you are on schedule)
  5. Schedule remaining important weekly activities
  6. Include personal tasks
  7. Plan on paper with proper buffers and timing
* Strategic block agenda:
  1. Reconnect with vision (5-10 min)
  2. Review metrics and indicators
  3. Identify breakdowns
  4. Work on plan tactics
* Studies show that proper planning can reduce time to complete a task by up to 20%


### [Defining your Vision (Pre-Planning)]
*****
1. Evaluate the following aspects of your life right now (rate 1-10)

	1. Spiritual
	
	 2. Relationships (friends and romantic)
	
	 3. Business
	
	 4. Family
	
	 5. Community
	
	 6. Physical
	
	 7. Personal

* Include notes for each as to why and what could improve each categories score

2. Define a specific vision for all 3 time-horizons: (should be big enough to be uncomfortable)
   
	* 12 Weeks from now
	  
	* 1-3 Years from now
	  
	* 5-10 Years from now
	  
	* Take some time to do this
	  
		* What does your daily life look like?
		  
		* How do you spend your time each day?
		  
		* Where do you live?
		  
		* What is your family life like?
		  
		* How much money do you make?
		  
		* What do you do for work?
		  
		* How often do you work?
  
### [Planning a 12-Week Year]
*****
1. Set **Sleep Goals**

	* It is highly recommended to get a Biometrics tracker that can effectively record your Sleep
	  
	* Set a predefined goal for Sleeping so many hours and minutes each night
	  
	* **Whoop** is highly recommended as it is extremely consistent and proactive with helping you get to bed on-time, understanding when you may need more sleep, and telling you overall how long you need to sleep each night
   
2. Set **Health Habits** that you will track for the 12-Week Year (**Health Tracker**)

	* These will be habits that you complete every single day
	  
	* ex. "Meditate for 10 Minutes", "Complete Scheduled Workout", "Stretch for 20 minutes"
	  
	* These should **not** be tasks towards your Weekly Tasks and 12-W Goals
	
		* These are habits directly related to maintaining your Health only
		  
			* If you Sleep correctly and maintain your Health it is scientifically proven you will be happier and will help to meet two of your three overall life criteria
			  
				* ex. Health, Happiness, and Wealth
   
4. Identify 1-3 Goals for your 12-Week Year (these must be the top priorities for your vision)
   
	* If you hit your goal - what would be different?
   
4. For each goal, spend 20 minutes identifying weekly strategies:
   - List minimal, chronological tasks required to achieve each goal.
   - Tasks must be leading indicators.

5. Weekly planning (60 minutes each week):
   - Plan performance blocks and daily strategies dynamically based on leading indicators.

### [Prioritization]
*****
* Priorities in execution:

	1. **Sleep** is the highest priority - without energy you won't get anything done
	   
	2. **Health** is second priority - focuses the body and mind (**Health Tracker**)
	   
	3. **Tasks** are third priority - give yourself energy then focus that energy into a plan

### [Adjusting your 12-Week Plan]
*****
* `“A good plan violently executed now is better than a perfect plan executed at some indefinite time in the future.” - George S. Patton Jr.`
  
* All plans will need adjustment as you go

	* Accept this reality and continually review your plan
	  
	* This is reasoning for leading indicators to provide real-time information

* Only adjust your plan from market feedback (ex. what was actually executed upon)

* Don't abandon your plan when you score poorly one week

	* Don't be afraid to confront your poor performance
	  
	* You likely are not currently performance at a 85% execution rate
	  
		* If you were, you wouldn't need this system
		  
		* Accept that you will have week that are failures
		  
		* Regularly adjust your plan based on actual execution feedback, not assumptions.
		* Accept that not all planned tasks will be completed; focus on critical actions and adjust accordingly.
		* The process of execution is more important than immediate results; build the habit of consistent execution.
		* Growth is in facing the facts about your ability to perform
