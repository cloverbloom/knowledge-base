# [The 12-W Year]
### [Core Concepts]
---
* Redefine a "year" as 12 weeks instead of 12 months to create urgency and improve execution

* Annualized thinking leads to procrastination; 12-week thinking creates focus and urgency

* Define and measure a **Weekly Score** to accurately measure your performance weekly

* Traditionally annualized plans (12 months) involve a high degree of uncertainty and are objective based

	* Shortening the time frame to 12 weeks increases the predictability and allows you to set proper goals and strategies (ex. start with verb then explicitly list required action)
	  
	* Allows you to better plan and develop certainty in the outcome

* Be great at 1-3 things instead of mediocre at many things

	* `"To write a great book, you must first become the book." –Naval Ravikant`
	  
		* This is a system to maximize my personal leverage

### [Vision & Planning]
*****
* Create a compelling vision that defines your long-term aspirations and desired future

* Develop 12-week plans with clear, specific goals that align with your vision

* `“You only have to doze a moment, and all is lost. For ruin and salvation both have their source inside you.”`

* `"You create things twice. First mentally, then physically."`

* You must be emotionally connected to the outcome

	* This will give you the necessary motivation to continue when it gets painful
  
* `"All my life I wanted to be somebody. Now I see I should have been more specific."`
  
* Ultimately this book is not revolutionary -
  
	* **it is simply presenting things you already know in a way that you cannot ignore**

### [Execution System]
*****
* Focus on lead indicators (actions) rather than lag indicators (results)

* Implement weekly plans and daily actions to drive consistent progress

* Execution is a habit where direct measurement of performance is required
  
* You are always most effective when present (mediation is very important for this)
  
* `"The whole is greater than the sum of the parts."` (must do all aspects)

### [Measurement & Accountability]
*****
* Accountability is ownership of the outcome regardless of the circumstances
  
	* Commitment is agreeing to future accountability
  
* Track execution consistently using a weekly scorecard (minimum 85% execution rate)

* Hold a weekly accountability meeting to review progress and adjust plans
  
* `"Value the outcome over your comfort. Always take the leap of faith."`
  
* With a minimum 85% execution rate (on time) you are likely to meet your goals
  
* 60% of breakdowns occur in the execution phase (most likely to fail when actually working)

* **Leading** and **Lagging** indicators:
  
	* Leading indicators are measures of progress toward an end result
	  
	* Lagging indicators are the end results themselves, representing past performance
	  
		* You want to stack leading indicators to give yourself as much game time information as possible

* **Weekly Score**

	* 

### [The 3 Principles]
*****
* The 3 principles are:
  
	* (i) **accountability** (the willingness to take full ownership for your actions and results regardless of your circumstances), 
	  
	* (ii) **commitment** (doing whatever it takes to keep the promises you’ve made to yourself and to others)
	  
	* (iii) **greatness in the moment** (making the countless decisions to take critical action even if you don’t feel like it, and immersing yourself fully in the present)

### [The 5 Disciplines]
*****
* (iv) **vision** - Clearly define what you want to achieve

* (v) **planning** - Create specific, actionable 12-week plans

* (vi) **process Control** - Establish consistent routines and systems

* (vii) **measurement** - Track and score your execution

* (viii) **time Use** - Focus on high-value activities and block distractions

### [Emotional Cycles]
*****
* Recognize the three emotional phases in each 12-week period: 
  
	* honeymoon, fight-through, and success

* Develop strategies to push through the "fight-through" phase when motivation wanes

* `"Don't be fair weather anything."`

* `"Excellence is not an act. It is a way of being."`

### [Control Time Use]
*****
* Practice the following:
  
	* (i) how to get the highest return on your time
	  
	* (ii) pre-planning your week
	  
	* (iii) using strategic blocks to safeguard your time from being hijacked
	  
* All of your time must be intentional
  
* `“Take care of the minutes and the year will take care of themselves”`
  
* Organize your week with dedicated time blocks (must be put into physical planner)
  
	* Strategic Blocks - 3 hours each day for intense work to produce breakthroughs
	  
	* Buffer Blocks - max 30 minutes per day to deal with unplanned and unorganized tasks 
	  
		* ex. email, phone calls, updates, etc.
	  
	* Breakout Blocks - 3 hours per day for scheduled time away from work to maintain

* Studies show that proper planning can reduce time to complete a task by up to 20%

### [Prioritization]
*****
* Priorities in execution:

	1. **Sleep** is the highest priority - without energy you won't get anything done
	   
	2. **Health** is second priority - focuses the body and mind (**Health Tracker**)
	   
	3. **Tasks** are third priority - give yourself energy then focus that energy into a plan

### [Planning a 12-Week Year]
*****
1. Establish a specific vision for all 3 time-horizons: (should be big enough to be uncomfortable)
   
		* 12 Weeks from now()
	  
		* 1-3 Years from now()
	
		* 5-10 Years from now()
	  
	* Evaluate the following aspects of your life right now (rate 1-10)
	  
		 1. Spiritual
		
		 2. Relationships (friends and romantic)
		
		 3. Business
		
		 4. Family
		
		 5. Community
		
		 6. Physical
		
		 7. Personal
	  
2. Set **Sleep Goals**
   
3. Set **Health Habits** that you will track for the 12-Week Year (**Health Tracker**)
   
4. Identify 1-3 Goals for your 12-Week Year (these must be the top priorities for your vision)
   
	* If you hit your goal - what would be different?
   
5. Spend 20 minutes per Goal to identify a number of weekly strategies that guarantee your goal
   
	* From this list compile a chronological order of the least number of tasks to complete each Goal
	  
	* These become your **Weekly Tasks** to complete each week

### [Adjusting your Plans]
*****
* `“A good plan violently executed now is better than a perfect plan executed at some indefinite time in the future.” - George S. Patton Jr.`
  
* All plans will need adjustment as you go

	* Accept this reality and continually review your plan
	  
	* This is reasoning for leading indicators to provide real-time information
	  
* Only adjust your plan from market feedback (ex. what was actually executed upon)
