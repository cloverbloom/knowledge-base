## Core Concepts
* Redefine a "year" as 12 weeks instead of 12 months to create urgency and improve execution
* Annualized thinking leads to procrastination; 12-week thinking creates focus and urgency

## Vision & Planning
* Create a compelling vision that defines your long-term aspirations and desired future
* Develop 12-week plans with clear, specific goals that align with your vision

## Execution System
* Focus on lead indicators (actions) rather than lag indicators (results)
* Implement weekly plans and daily actions to drive consistent progress

## Measurement & Accountability
* Track execution consistently using a weekly scorecard (minimum 85% execution rate)
* Hold a weekly accountability meeting to review progress and adjust plans

## The 5 Disciplines
* Vision - Clearly define what you want to achieve
* Planning - Create specific, actionable 12-week plans
* Process Control - Establish consistent routines and systems
* Measurement - Track and score your execution
* Time Use - Focus on high-value activities and block distractions

## Emotional Cycles
* Recognize the three emotional phases in each 12-week period: honeymoon, fight-through, and success
* Develop strategies to push through the "fight-through" phase when motivation wanes

# Self Scout
*****
* Use this time for rest, fun, and deep reflection on what was accomplished and any short comings from the past two 12-W Years.
	* [ ] Create a task list for this period (must include tasks for both relaxation and reflection)
