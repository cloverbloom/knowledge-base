### [Core Concepts]
*****
* Weaknesses rarely become strengths; consistently leveraging your strengths yields the greatest returns.
* Choose to spend time on activities that generate the highest payoffs.
* Everything requires sacrifice; comfort is often the first thing you must sacrifice.
* "Eventually everyone sits down at a banquet of consequences."

### [Vision & Planning]
*****
* Review your vision daily to maintain emotional investment in your goals.
* Clearly define 1-3 core capabilities that align with your strengths and interests for sustained motivation and performance.

### [Execution System]
*****
* Spend 8am-12pm daily on focused performance blocks.
* Initially schedule breakout blocks monthly, then transition to weekly once consistent.
* Strategic blocks are your most important activities; schedule them consistently each week.
* Avoid deferring today's tasks to tomorrow; this habit undermines execution.

### [Measurement & Accountability]
*****
* Action occurs when your stated intentions outweigh hidden intentions; evaluate the true cost of your actions.
* Trust is lost when commitments are not met; accountability starts with personal ownership.
* Never wait for external circumstances to change; proactively manage your accountability.

### [Control Time Use]
*****
* Interruptions cost significant productivity; it takes approximately 15 minutes to regain focus after each distraction.
* Follow the Model Work Week:
  1. Review previous week (15 min)
  2. Schedule strategic blocks
  3. Schedule 1-2 buffer blocks daily
  4. Schedule breakout blocks
  5. Schedule remaining important weekly activities
  6. Include personal tasks
  7. Plan on paper with proper buffers and timing
* Strategic block agenda:
  1. Reconnect with vision (5-10 min)
  2. Review metrics and indicators
  3. Identify breakdowns
  4. Work on plan tactics

### [Emotional Cycles]
*****
* Recognize and manage emotional tension as deadlines approach; turning back is not an option.
* Maintain consistency, especially during the middle weeks when motivation wanes.

### [Planning your Week]
*****
* Never start a week without a clear weekly plan.
* Weekly planning should include measurable execution strategies and clearly defined performance blocks.
* Understand you likely cannot finish everything planned; prioritize effectively.
* Use a physical planner to reinforce accountability and visibility of tasks.

### [Adjusting your 12-Week Plan]
*****
* Regularly adjust your plan based on actual execution feedback, not assumptions.
* Accept that not all planned tasks will be completed; focus on critical actions and adjust accordingly.
* The process of execution is more important than immediate results; build the habit of consistent execution.

### [Prioritization]
*****
* Anything accomplished was prioritized; anything not accomplished was not a priority.
* Prioritize difficult tasks over busy work to improve efficiency and effectiveness.
