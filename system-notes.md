12-W Year

On average, it takes 15 minutes to get back to focused work after a notification in that 27% of the average professionals day is spent dealing with interruptions 

  

I should spend 8-12am every day on performance blocks no matter what

  

The more I confront difficult tasks and avoid busy work it will get easier and I will move faster

  

“Eventually everyone sits down at a banquet of consequences.”

  

Everything takes sacrifices. The number one thing you must sacrifice is your comfort

  

Choose to spend time on the things that generate the biggest payoffs 

  

Weaknesses rarely become strengths. the concentrated impact of consistently playing into your strengths is where returns come from 

  

Define 1-3 capabilities. These are likely things you enjoy. This is how you get endless motivation, performance, and satisfaction

  

^ these are performance time blocks (habit.MD)

  

Performance time are three hours per week where you work on your business not in it

  

Breakout blocks are only 1 per month until you get on schedule

  

Then go to 1 per week

  

Performance time is at a minimum 4 hours per day 8-12

  

Use Model Work Week

1. 15 minutes first thing of week to review last week
2. Schedule strategic block
3. Schedule 1-2 buffer blocks per day
4. Schedule a breakout block
5. Schedule all remaining important activities for your week
6. Personal tasks
7. Must work on paper with proper buffers and timing

  

Strategic block agenda

1. Reconnect with your vision. 5-10 minutes to assess progress
2. Review your current metrics and indicators
3. Can you identify breakdowns
4. Work on plan tactics

  

Understand you likely cannot finish everything you planned.

  

Do not defer your plan to try to get ahead ( not possible )

  

Saying you will do what you should tomorrow is fatally flawed

  

Millionaires work differently, not harder, the strategic blocks or your most important 

  

Try to plan your blocks at the same times during the week.

  

“If you want something you don’t currently have, you have to do something you are not currently doing.”

  

If you want others to be accountable, you must show accountability. If you want others to care they must have ownership.

  

Never wait for things outside of your control to change.

  

I will call my mom every week once I move

  

You need to be emotionally invested into your goals

  

I am way to comfortable at home

  

Anything that happens was made a priority. Anything that didn’t happen was not a priority.

  

Action happens when your stated intentions are stronger than your hidden intentions.

  

Consider the costs for each of your actions. This will expose your hidden intentions for each goal and allow you to identify its value.

  

People lose trust when you fail your commitments.

  

The process is more important than the result

  

I want to hit my goals and I think that is the most important thing at this current phase in life is that building up an emotional bank account with only myself before I deal with others is crucial right now as I make these big steps in life 

  

Review your vision every single day

The reason I like the planner is that I can just automatically assign tasks to my day and it helps Samantha and I also learned to respect a paper planner because if I miss something, I don’t have a reminder so I have to just do it when I see it
